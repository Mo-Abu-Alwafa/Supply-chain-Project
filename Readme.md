### Data Quality & Exploration
- **Data Exploration:** Checked for missing values, duplicates, and basic statistics
- **Numerical Analysis:** Used histograms and boxplots to assess distributions and outliers
- **Categorical Analysis:** Count plots for key categorical variables (e.g., shipping carriers, suppliers, locations)

### Pattern & Relationship Analysis
- Boxplots and scatterplots for product type vs. revenue, price vs. sales, availability vs. revenue

### Product Analysis
- Aggregated by product type for sales, revenue, price, and availability
- Identified top products, low stock, quality issues, and high shipping costs

### Supplier & Shipping Analysis
- Assessed supplier performance (lead time, defect rates, revenue)
- Shipping performance by carrier and mode

### Customer Analysis
- Revenue and product preferences by demographic

### Regional Insights
- Performance metrics by location (revenue, lead time, shipping time, defect rate)
